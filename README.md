# Overview
Welcome to My Mood dApp! This decentralized application (dApp) allows you to interact with your personal blockchain to track and record your daily mood. Whether you want to keep a mood journal, understand your emotional patterns, or simply have fun, My Mood dApp is here to help you keep track of your feelings.

## Features

# How it Works
My Mood dApp is powered by blockchain technology, which means every mood entry you make is recorded as a transaction on the blockchain. This ensures that your mood data is tamper-proof and can be accessed only by you. Here's a brief overview of how the dApp works:

1. **Connect Wallet**: To get started, connect your compatible blockchain wallet to the dApp.
2. **Record Mood**: Once connected, you can record your mood for the day by selecting the appropriate emotion from a predefined list.
3. **Submit Transaction**: After choosing your mood, submit the transaction to the blockchain. The entry will be securely recorded.
4. **View History**: You can access your mood history at any time through the dApp interface. It will display your past mood entries in chronological order.
